Committee Meeting #1

Attendees:
* Zandro
* Rahul
* Denisa
* Diederik
* Helga
* Alice

Global TA loved Rahul’s email. The only thing that needs to change is not to centralise the Facebook group. 
- Remove the Facebook group unless Helga is added as a moderator.
- Helga needs to check if we can create a Facebook group first and whether we can keep the group up.
- Yammer is where the TA want us to centralise the presence of the society.
- We want to have the external social network (Facebook) to be able to organise events without spamming Yammer. We can always do a round up on Yammer.

Global Intern Innovation Challenge
Helga wants us to start promoting for the GIIC at some point in the future as this is a big event and we want to get the interns involved!

Denisa will join up with a new intern on Fiona’s (new) team to do with the employability brand of ARM.

Bowling (First Society)
We want to partially subsidise the price (£3.66 for one game one person), so we can do £4 for two games per person with the £350 budget we have. (We’d use £250 of the budget).
- Do not promise refunds as it can get messy.
- We will spend our lunchtimes this week to meet the interns and sell tickets.

Budget
We can manage our own budget across multiple occasions. However, Helga did say she’d like it to go towards one event.
