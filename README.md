Committee Meeting #3

BAKE SALE
- Get trollies to go around the offices and sell the cakes with a friendly face to encourage people (especially busy/lazy).
- Can send an email out to all Cambridge to take orders for pre-sales and deliver them in the morning (a team did this last year and was effective)
- Talk to people who have meetings and ask if they’d like to have cake for meetings (could do discounts for big orders)
- A slice would probably sit at £1 ish, maybe try to get a cake to last 20 slices
- Brownies could be £1.50
- Cupcakes could be £2
- Lunchtime setup a few stands around campus, ARM 3 kitchen, atrium etc
- Get in contact with interns around all of cambridge and get as many interns involved with baking! Acknowledgement will be given to those that get involved
- If we raise £1000, we get an extra £1000 matched by ARM
- Splitting up around campus is essential for the domination game, since the committee all work in separate teams we already have a nice spread.

Charities
- EARS.org,
- Poll on Yammer on which charity to use. 
- Week of the 7th August. 



NEXT SOCIAL
012233 58899 - Miso Cambridge (ask how many are in a booth) or try to get a deal

6:30pm - 8:30pm is the ideal time (2 hours)

Reserve between 30-40 spaces

- The Snug Bar (Grafton) do a karaoke night on Sunday at 7pm, this isn’t after work as its a weekend day but it could be a potential option as its a nice venue (by the looks of the photos) and it could well be cheaper if its a public night.
- (Sing your heart out and enjoy a great night out with our ever popular Karaoke night. As well as having 2-4-1 cocktails all day and night we're also giving you and your friends FREE nachos when you book a table in advance.)

Cambridge, CB1 1DB

A pub/bar that have a public karaoke night is going to be better for our budget.

Committee Meeting #1

Attendees:
* Zandro
* Rahul
* Denisa
* Diederik
* Helga
* Alice

Global TA loved Rahul’s email. The only thing that needs to change is not to centralise the Facebook group. 
- Remove the Facebook group unless Helga is added as a moderator.
- Helga needs to check if we can create a Facebook group first and whether we can keep the group up.
- Yammer is where the TA want us to centralise the presence of the society.
- We want to have the external social network (Facebook) to be able to organise events without spamming Yammer. We can always do a round up on Yammer.

Global Intern Innovation Challenge
Helga wants us to start promoting for the GIIC at some point in the future as this is a big event and we want to get the interns involved!

Denisa will join up with a new intern on Fiona’s (new) team to do with the employability brand of ARM.

Bowling (First Society)
We want to partially subsidise the price (£3.66 for one game one person), so we can do £4 for two games per person with the £350 budget we have. (We’d use £250 of the budget).
- Do not promise refunds as it can get messy.
- We will spend our lunchtimes this week to meet the interns and sell tickets.

Budget
We can manage our own budget across multiple occasions. However, Helga did say she’d like it to go towards one event.
